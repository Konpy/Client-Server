# Client-Server
In this program utilizing Java we made a Client-Server based program where the server can take any number of clients and calculate the prime numbers of a given number. In other words if i were to put the number 10000 in client this gets sent to the server and gives the client the number 1229 because there are 1229 prime numbers between 0 to 10000
